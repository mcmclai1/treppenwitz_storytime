A long time ago, in a mythical period known as the 90s, Schloss Rammstein arose in Berlin, and German dance-metal washed over the land.
Many dance-metal concerts happened along the biergartens on the hauptstrasse as people danced and head-banged the nights away.
There existed a hund named Eltz, who harrassed the town by racing his Porche down Berlin's hauptstrasse, wearing a pair of lederhose, and eating apfelkuchen.
Schloss in his BMW lined up alongside Eltz challenging him to a race, first to reach the Baeckerei wins. 
This race was very wettbewerbsfaehig so Eltz decided he needed to save his Porsche's energy by turning off the klimaanlage.
Eltz began to inch ahead as Schloss began to lose focus, in an effort to recover his energy he pulled some Brot from his Dirndel.
Hauptstrasse was filled with laughter as people watched the unexpected spectacle unfold.
Meanwhile, a mysterious character named Bratwurst Man appeared in the Biergarten, offering Bratwurst to everyone in exchange for dance moves. 
The dance-metal beats resumed, echoing through the Hauptstrasse, creating memories that would be shared in the Ratskeller for years to come.  
People emerged from the local ratskeller after smelling the bratwurst, quickly developing into the biggest wettbewerbsfaehig dance off seen in the streets of Berlin. 
Bratwurst Man then revealed the grand prize, a magical pair of chain mail lederhose with a built-in klimaanlage, and the dancing grew fiercer.
Amidst the joyous celebration, Eltz and Schloss, having reconciled after their spirited race, decided to visit the local Baeckerei together and indulge in freshly baked Gebaecks.
As the scent of freshly baked Gebaecks wafted through the air, Eltz and Schloss, having reconciled after their race, joined the joyous celebration emerging from the local ratskeller.
Under the twinkling lights of the Biergarten, Eltz and Schloss raised their glasses in a toast, sharing treppenwitz and laughter enjoying the fun after their race. 
Alas, in all the excitement, Schloss dropped his Apfelkuchen on the ground!
Before Schloss could bend down to pick it up, a hund came out of nowhere and scarfed it down!
